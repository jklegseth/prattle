## Prattle

### A React chat app for prattling, blathering and babbling!

Mostly a project to play with React and build something fun. Currently uses a Firebase backend with Google Auth and [Material-UI](http://www.material-ui.com/#/).

### Todos and nice-to-haves

I'm not sure how much I'll do as this is a sandbox project and I need to get back to other React training I'm doing to get deeper into things.
	
- I'd like to add more auth options just for fun. To do that effectively I think I'd add a router and route the sign in flow to a standalone page, then redirect to the proper app on auth.

- Group messages by date (day) instead of showing a date/time for each one, the way Slack does, a dividing line for the day and then just a simple timestamp per message.

- Add emoticons, just for the learning

- Add the ability for a user to delete a prior message of theirs

- Show number of people in a room, or maybe just online

- Indicate when someone is typing
